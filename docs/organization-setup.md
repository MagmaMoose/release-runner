# Organization Setup

Do this once before onboarding repositories.

## Recommended Auth: Release Runner GitHub App

Most repositories should use the default `auth-mode: public-app`.

For users, this means:

1. Install the Release Runner GitHub App on the organization or selected repository.
2. Allow the app through branch protection or repository rulesets if releases write protected refs.
3. Grant release jobs `id-token: write`.
4. Keep the default auth inputs.

Workflow permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write
  packages: write
```

Use `packages: write` only when Docker image build or promotion is enabled.

Release job:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: calebsargeant/semantic-release@v1
    with:
      mode: release
```

## When To Use Another Auth Mode

| Auth mode | Use it when | What users configure |
|---|---|---|
| `public-app` | You install the Release Runner GitHub App | App installation and `id-token: write` |
| `private-app` | Your organization owns the GitHub App | App ID and private key secrets |
| `github-token` | Branch protection allows `GITHUB_TOKEN` to release | `contents: write` and optional `pull-requests: write` |
| `auto` | You want private app auth when secrets exist, otherwise workflow token | Private app secrets or workflow token permissions |

## Private GitHub App

Use this when your organization does not want to use the Release Runner GitHub App.

Create a GitHub App with repository permissions:

| Permission | Access |
|---|---|
| Contents | Read and write |
| Pull requests | Read and write |
| Metadata | Read-only |

Add `Workflows: Read and write` only if your release process intentionally edits workflow files.

Then:

1. Install the app on target repositories.
2. Save the app ID as `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_APP_ID`.
3. Generate a private key and save the full PEM as `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
4. Allow the app in any branch protection or rulesets that would otherwise block release writes.

Workflow input:

```yaml
- uses: calebsargeant/semantic-release@v1
  with:
    mode: release
    auth-mode: private-app
    app-id: ${{ secrets.SEMANTIC_RELEASE_APP_ID }}
    app-private-key: ${{ secrets.SEMANTIC_RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

## Workflow Token

Use `auth-mode: github-token` only when the repository allows `GITHUB_TOKEN` to create everything your release requires.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  packages: write

steps:
  - uses: calebsargeant/semantic-release@v1
    with:
      mode: release
      auth-mode: github-token
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This mode is useful for simple repositories, but it commonly fails with strict protected branches or rulesets.

## Branch Protection Checklist

Confirm the selected release actor can:

- create and push tags
- create GitHub Releases
- push release commits when the versioning tool updates files
- push `promote/<environment>/<version>` branches when promotion PRs are enabled
- open promotion pull requests

If rulesets require signed commits, status checks, linear history, or specific bypass actors, configure the selected app or token actor before enabling releases.
