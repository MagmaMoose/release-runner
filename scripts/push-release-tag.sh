# Push a release tag to origin with race-safe handling.
#
# Used by the gitversion-tag and version-override-tag steps in action.yml.
# Encapsulates the authenticated-URL resolution + tag-already-exists
# pre-check + create/push/race-recovery loop that those two steps share.
#
# Required env:
#   TAG           - the tag to publish (e.g., v1.2.3)
#   GITHUB_TOKEN  - auth token; embedded into the HTTPS remote URL
#
# Optional env:
#   MESSAGE       - annotated-tag message. If unset/empty, a lightweight
#                   tag is created instead.
#   GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL  - identity for `git config`; default
#                   to the github-actions bot.
#
# Side effects:
#   - Configures git user.name / user.email only when each is not already
#     set in the local git config. A caller that pre-configures their own
#     identity is preserved.
#   - Writes `released=true|false` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when that variable is
#     set (always set inside an Actions step). The caller is responsible
#     for any tool-specific outputs (version, tag, etc.).
#   - Writes git push stderr to a per-invocation temp file under
#     ${RUNNER_TEMP:-/tmp} and removes it on exit via a trap, so
#     concurrent invocations in the same job don't read each other's
#     diagnostics.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - tag is on remote (either we pushed it, or a concurrent run did)
#   1 - unsupported remote URL, or push failed for a non-race reason
#
# Race semantics:
#   - If the remote already has TAG when we start, we treat that as a
#     no-op release (released=false) and exit 0.
#   - If we create the tag locally and the push fails, we re-check the
#     remote. If TAG now exists, we lost a race between check and push;
#     drop the local tag and exit 0 with released=false.
#   - Otherwise we surface the first 3 lines of git push stderr and
#     exit 1 so the workflow can diagnose auth / ruleset / network issues.
